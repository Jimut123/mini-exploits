# mini-exploits

The story goes like this: 

If you complete every solution of Louden, you will get something in common (very likely 10% chance), and there is no particular book which is being used by the cirriculum. The good part is I have found the solution using some of my robot-scrapers, but the bad part is the answers are encrypted. 

Lets try out some cracking stuffs as "old school", without using any "Kali Linux" tools.

Some part of the codes were being worked on earlier, and some part are modified. These codes are in public domain, so use it at your own risk.


The normal hexdump will give something like this (and yeah that power9k :sunglasses: ):

![hexdump png](/img/hexdump.png)

Next use the pdf-parser and pdf-id to get the encryption information (standard or not?) and Header of pdf file as shown:

![pdf parser](/img/pdf_parser.png)

Get the encryption dump in binary :

![encryption dump](/img/encrypt_pdf_parser.png)

Finally find the hash and run it in something like hash-cat (yeah you need crunch or something like that, dictionary attack won't do, would be good if you could somewhat learn the human intent by training on Kenneth's text and find the possible reduce space of password.)
